# CPE/CSC 203 Project - Virtual World | Regular Show

This Java project is an object-oriented virtual world game that showcases object-oriented programming (OOP), refactoring techniques, and multithreading. The game also incorporates A* pathfinding algorithms to navigate characters efficiently within the world. The project structure consists of various Java classes that define the world, characters, interactions, and game logic. 

In the game, the player navigates a character named Mordecai, from the popular show Regular Show, through a virtual world where his objective is to collect burritos scattered throughout the landscape. Upon collecting burritos, Mordecai returns them to the house, and once a certain threshold (X number) of burritos is reached, the game's antagonist, Evil Rigby, stops cutting down trees and returns to eat the burritos. After consuming the burritos, Evil Rigby transforms into Good Rigby. The game also allows for the spawning of multiple Evil Rigbys, adding an element of strategy and challenge. The gameplay is designed with engaging character interactions and pathfinding, creating an immersive and dynamic experience.
